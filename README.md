# Processing Uberon data

[Uberon](uberon.org/ "Uberon Ontology Homepage") is "an integrated cross-species ontology â€¦ representing a variety of anatomical entities. [[source](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r5 "Uberon, an integrative multi-species anatomy ontology")]" We [use Uberon](https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d41 "Thinklab discussion") as the vocabulary to represent anatomical structures for our drug repurposing research.
